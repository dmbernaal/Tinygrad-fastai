This repo is an attempt to do the FastAI course Part-2 from 2022 in Tinygrad

## 1. Install Tinygrad
Follow the instructions from the tinygrad repo: [https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad]

## Note: Messy
This will be very messy at first so bear with me if you are using this repo to learn things. I'm learning things and certainly am NOT an expert just a degen who likes programming and loves AI
